An application with which you can quickly launch 
other applications on your computer or open links.
You can set a list of phrases for a specific 
action yourself. This is configured in the "Applist" file. 
File format: 

#Action1 name
link or path to exe
phrase1
phrase2
phrase3
#Action2 name
link or path to exe
phrase1
phrase2
phrase3

For examle:
#Paint
"C:\WINDOWS\system32\mspaint.exe"
паинт
пэинт
gfbyn
g'byn
paint
#Панель управления
"C:\WINDOWS\system32\control.exe"

I use Russian keyboard layout so I also write phrases 
in Russian with English keyboard layout.

After that create QuickLaunch folder in Program Files 
and place this file (Applist.txt) and png icon with name Launch.png there.

For quick run of this app you can create shortcut
on the taskbar and call it with win + [1] key combination.

For closing app you can use esc or press enter with an empty text line.
