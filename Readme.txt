I use Russian keyboard layout so I also write phrases 
in Russian with English keyboard layout.

After that create QuickLaunch folder in Program Files 
and place this file and png icon there.

For quick run of this app you can create shortcut
on the taskbar and call it with win + [1] key combination.

For closing app you can use esc or press enter with an empty text line.
